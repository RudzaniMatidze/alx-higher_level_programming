- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
#
### Tasks:
#### 0. Import a simple function from a simple file
Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3

- You have to use print function with string format to display integers
- You have to assign:
	- the value 1 to a variable called a
	- the value 2 to a variable called b
	- and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print
- a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 1 and another b = 2
- Your program should print: <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed with a new line
- You can only use the word add_0 once in your code
- You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
- Your code should not be executed when imported - by using __import__, like the example below

#
#### 1. My first toolbox!

Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.

- Do not use the function print (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times
- You have to define:
	- the value 10 to a variable a
	- the value 5 to a variable b
	- and use those two variables only, as arguments when calling functions (including print)
- a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 10 and another b = 5
- Your program should call each of the imported functions. See example below for format
- the word calculator_1 should be used only once in your file
- You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
- Your code should not be executed when imported
